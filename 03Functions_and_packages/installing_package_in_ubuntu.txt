How To Install NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source library for the Python programming
 language. It is used for scientific computing and working with arrays.

Apart from its multidimensional array object, it also provides high-level
 functioning tools for working with arrays

Installing NumPy
Step 1: Check Python Version
To check whether you have Python 2, run the command:
python -V
The output should give you a version number.

To see if you have Python 3 on your system, enter the following in the
 terminal window:
python3 -V

Step 2: Install Pip
The easiest way to install NumPy is by using Pip. Pip a package manager for
 installing and managing Python software packages.
Unlike Python, Pip does not come preinstalled on most operating systems.
 Therefore, you need to set up the package manager that corresponds to the
 version of Python you have. If you have both versions of Python, install
 both Pip versions as well.
he commands below use the apt utility as we are installing on Ubuntu 
Install Pip (for Python 2) by running:
sudo apt install python-pip

If you need Pip for Python 3, use the command:
sudo apt install python3-pip

Finally, verify you have successfully installed Pip by typing pip -V
 and/or pip3 -V

Step 3: Install NumPy
With Pip set up, you can use its command line for installing NumPy.

Install NumPy with Python 2 by typing:
pip install numpy

To install NumPy with the package manager for Python 3, run:
pip3 install numpy

Step 4: Verify NumPy Installation
Use the show command to verify whether NumPy is now part of you Python
 packages:
pip show numpy

And for Pip3 type:
pip3 show numpy

The output should confirm you have NumPy, which version you are using,
 as well as where the package is stored.

Step 5: Import the NumPy Package
After installing NumPy you can import the package and set an alias for it.
To do so, move to the python prompt by typing one of the following
 commands: 

python 

python3

Once you are in the python or python3 prompt you can import the new
 package and add an alias for it (in the example below it is np):

import numpy as np
