#The general recipe for an if statement.It reads as follow:If condition, execute expression. Notice the colon at the end,
#and the fact that you simmply have to indent the python code with four spaces(or a tab) to tell python what to do in the 
#case the condition succeeds.
#To exit the if statement, simply continue with some python code without indentation,and python will know that it's not 
# part of the if statement.
