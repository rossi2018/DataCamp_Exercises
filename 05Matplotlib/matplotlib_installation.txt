Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
 It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.

Pyplot is a Matplotlib module which provides a MATLAB-like interface. Matplotlib is designed to be as usable as MATLAB, with the ability to
 use Python, and the advantage of being free and open-source.
