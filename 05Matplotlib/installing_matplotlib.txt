Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding
 plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine
 (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged.[3] SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.

If you are on Linux, you might prefer to use your package manager. Matplotlib is packaged for almost every major Linux distribution.
Debian / Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
