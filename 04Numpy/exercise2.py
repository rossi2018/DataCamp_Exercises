#Height is gotten from http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_MLB_HeightsWeights
#I scrape the data from the above website using this formular in google doc excel programm "=ImportHtml("http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_MLB_HeightsWeights", "table", 0)"
#The general formular is "=ImportHtml(URL, "table", num)"
#URL here is the URL of the page (between quotation marks)
#“table” is the element to look for (Google Docs can also import lists)
#and num is the number of the element, in case there are more on the same page (which is rather common
#  for tables). The latter supposedly starts at 1, but I had to use 0 to get it to pick up the correct table 
#Once this is done, Google Docs retrieves the data and inserts it into the spreadsheet, including the
#  headers. The last step is to download the spreadsheet as a CSV file.
# After downloading it as a csv, i had to copy and past the height here due to fact that i dont  no a
#shortcut/script to automate it for me
